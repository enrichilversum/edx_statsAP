### Nonlinear Regression

* Datasets can be found here: 

http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/strd/nls/nls_main.shtml

To import the .dat files use the following: 

For convienience I place the URL into a variable, then I check the file out with readLine() and find out were it ends. 

```{r}

dat_URL="http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/strd/nls/data/LINKS/DATA/Misra1a.dat"

readLine(dat_URL)

read.table(dat_URL,skip=60)

```
As I can't figure out how to make it behave so that it doesn't paste the headers into the first line I will just skip the header=TRUE argument and add the headers myself.

```{r}
nonlinear01 <- read.table(dat_URL,skip=60)
names(nonlinear01) <- c("y","x")
View(nonlinear01)
```

That's it.
