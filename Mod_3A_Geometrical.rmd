### The Geometrial distibution

This means: Teh amount of failures of Bernoulli trials until a success is achieved. The Function in R to do that is `dgeom(x,prog,log=T/F)`. Note that the value of x has to be the number of trials-1

Thus, for exercise on part 1: 

```{r}
#this is the first question about the circular spinner
trials <- 5
x <- trials-1 #just to make it clear
prob <- (1/10)

round((dgeom(x,prob)), digits=2)

```

#### Getting at least one success in x trials

`pgeom(q,prob)`  with q = trials - 1

#### Getting one success in more than x trials

`pgeom(q,prob,ower.tail=TRUE)` with q = trials-1
