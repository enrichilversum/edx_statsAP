## Mean of population or sample

Population  $\mu=\frac{\sum_x}{N}$

Sample $\bar{x}=\frac{\sum_x}{n}$

The rounding is done after the division and values above 0.5 are  rounded up as 1

## Median of a population
-Odd = de central value
-Even = average of the middle 2 values (or just the `median()` function in R )

## weighted mean
The function is  `weighted.mean(x,w)` and it requires two vectors of equal length

Example; 

```{r} 

v1x <- c(105,155,185)
v1w <- c(22,7,10)

weighted.mean(v1x,v1w)

# Be careful with sorting, the w and x values are dependant variables (!)


```
