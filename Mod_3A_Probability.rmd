## Probability (Intro)

### Resources: 

Besides the resources in eDX there is a very nice and to the point free book in cran: 

https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/IPSUR/vignettes/IPSUR.pdf 
(or here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/aitc45w5z11n45b/IPSUR.pdf?dl=0)



This supersedes the need for other texts for this course.

The necessary pacakges to follow chapeter 4 are   "prob" and "combinat": 


install.packages("prob")   (It doesn't work with knitr)
install.packages("combinat") 



### Sample Space

The sample space of an experiment (for instance coin toss with H being heads and T being toes):  $E$ is $$S={H,T}$$

An useful function is tosscoin which generates such sample spaces: 

```{r}
library(prob)

S_space <- tosscoin(3)

````

the function rolldie() cannot be found so that I have made my own : 

```{r}
rolldie <- function(n,m) sample(1:m,n,replace=T)
```
