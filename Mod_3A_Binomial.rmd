### A small function to find coeficcients given a vector x and an integer n: 

```{r}
cfnt <- function(n,x) {
        # just for clarities sake I calculate the factorials first
        fx = factorial(x)
        fn = factorial(n)
        fn_x = factorial(n-x)
        
        rval = fn / (fx*fn_x)
        
        return(rval)
}

# Example, like in Mod3A Binomial Dist, Part 4

x <- c(0:4)
n <- 4

cfnt(4,x)


```
